# SpaCy

SpaCy is a recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkit written in C and Python.  SpaCy was written with the explicit intent that developers could carry projects built on SpaCy into production with relative ease.  

SpaCy has [excellent (and configurable) installation instructions](https://spacy.io/usage/).

[Downloading SpaCy models is similarly well documented](https://spacy.io/usage/models).

SpaCy doesn't really have a default output.  It's NER tools take [a document](https://spacy.io/api/doc) as a string and breaks it into [spans](https://spacy.io/api/span).  SpaCy does include [`displacy`](https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers), a visualization tool which can display data produced by SpaCy.
