- Does it cost money?
- Is it open source?
- What kinds of entities does it identify?
- Does it require downloading model data? (how large is the data?)
    - are there different prebuilt models?
- Does it have a CLI?
- Can it be integrated into another program?
    - If so, what programming languages?
- What kind of output do you get?
- How fast is it?
- Does it provide cross referencing of entities?
    - between matches in the output?
    - to wikipedia, or another knowledge base?
- Qualitatively...
    - Did it miss entities?  A few?  A lot?
    - Did it misclassify entities?
